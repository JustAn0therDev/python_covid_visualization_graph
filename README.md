# python_covid_visualization_graph
A simple python (Python 3) project to visualize the growth in number of any country's COVID-19 total cases.

## Installation and Packages

This project uses the matplotlib package, so remember to run the following command (install `pip` first if you don't have it installed yet) on the terminal before compiling:
`python -m pip install -U matplotlib`

If you have any problems on compiling the code, try `python3 main.py` or installing the missing packages by running `pip3 install -U matplotlib` since it was made with Python 3. 

## Notes
This is a simple project created in twenty minutes (-ish) so I could visualize the growth of cases for the countries I wanted to check out. I am still improving it as the days go by so if you notice a different behavior or new features, that might be why.

The original CSV from where I got the data can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)

To run, just download the file in the same folder of the project and run `python main.py`. It should compile the code and show you the graph.
