# python_covid_visualization_graph
A simple python project to visualize the growth in number of Brazil's COVID-19 total cases.

## Notes
This is a simple project created in twenty minutes (-ish) so I could visualize the growth of cases for the countries I wanted to check out.

The original CSV from where I got the data can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)
